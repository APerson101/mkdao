# HrDAO

A platform to build and manage commnunities


## What it does
We decided to build a cross-chain DAO creating and account management platform. People can come together to create a DAO, a multisig wallet and automatic accounting so users don't have to use another accounting tool.

## How we built it
The front end was built with bootstrap, the mobile app was built with flutter. The platform connects to the the hedera hashgraph and BSC chain via chainlink, the latest price feed is gotten from Moonriver via chainlink. When community managers make transactions, the NFT receipt is stored on Skynet. We leveraged platforms such as Firebase, Hardhat, Remix to enable quick prototyping.

## Challenges we ran into
Due to time constraints, we were unable to resolve all the issues we had such as more advanced features on the app such as notifications.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build a functional product that runs on the Hedera hashgraph testnet and the BSC chain testnet.

## What's next for HrDAO
We plan to polish our user interface and add more integration with discord bot and twitter bot to enable users do more without having to leave the app.
